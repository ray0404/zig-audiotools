for each of the 9 potential DSPs outlined in dsp-manifest.md, conduct sufficient research to create verbose, detailed, high-level implementation blueprints for each of the 9 DSPs; save the respective DSP research/blueprints in their own blueprint files (potentially within a new DSP-blueprint/ directory), then create custom tailored jules-directives and AGENTS.md file for each of the 9 DSP blueprints. Finally, give me either a command to start a new jules task (via jules CLI) for each of the 9 DSPs, loading the repo with only onde DSP blueprint and coresponding AGENTS.md file at a time (for a total of 9 jules tasks; one fore each of the 9 DSPs in the manifest) *or* you (gemini CLI) start a /jules task for each of the 9 DSPs within the dsp-manifest.md with each DSPs corresponding AGENTS.md file as the AGENTS.md for the repo, and direct referenceing the respective DSPs blueprint file directly within the jules prompt, within AGENTS.md, or both. The outcome should be 9 Jules tasks created, each with their own AGENTS.md and DSP blueprint file as jules prompt and/or reference guide.
